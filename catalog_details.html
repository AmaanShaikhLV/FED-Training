            A chair is a piece of furniture with a raised surface, commonly used
            to seat a single person. Chairs are supported most often by four
            legs and have a back;however, a chair can have three legs or can
            have a different shape.

            One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat. Its
            primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as
            back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle,
            with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in
            turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to
            three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers
            can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on
            the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from
            the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical
            back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the
            shoulder blades). The legs are typically high enough for the seated
            person's thighs and knees to form a 90°-or-lesser angle.
